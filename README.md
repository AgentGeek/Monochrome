# Monochrome
 My attempt at a generic manga CMS

## Usage
Monochrome requires (at least for now) a copy of this repository, [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 
and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to run.

Once those requirementes are fulfilled you need to setup your [.env](#Environment settings) and simply run 
`make install` and the different services will be launched.

## Environment settings
Monochrome uses a `.env` file to take your settings,
an example is provided [here](/D34DPlayer/Monochrome/blob/main/.env.example).

### Variables
*Note: The database should be isolated by docker and only accessible by the Monochrome API, however using 
unique username and password is very recommended.*

* `DB_NAME` Name for the database.
* `DB_USER` User to connect the database with.
* `DB_PASSWORD` Password of that user.
* `SECRET_KEY` Secret used to encrypt the connections, change it asap.

*Note: Those can and are recommended to be completely random, to generate them you can use* `make secret`
